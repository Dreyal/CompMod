### Alien Commander
* Consume
    * Essentially recycle for the Alien side. 
    * Allows commanders to recycle their structures to get the supply cost back. 
    * Does not give resources back. 
* Lifeform egg drops removed

### Marine Commander
* NanoShield
    * Search range lowered to 3 from 6
        * Placing NanoShield on a specific player is difficult in a group because it tends to target the wrong player.
        * This is fixed by lowering the search range.
        * Vanilla NanoShield has similar behaviour to how NanoBoost was before the sensitivity options were added. Example [here](https://gfycat.com/smugharmlessblacklab-overwatch-ana-why-tho)
